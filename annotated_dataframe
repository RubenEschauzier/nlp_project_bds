67402,6368,6138,2,2020-08-29,27856,"Unfortunately, I know the answer to this question from personal experience. Several years ago, before I knew anything about exercise physiology, in a misguided attempt to gain muscle weight I shifted from a diet in caloric balance (approximately 2500 calories a day) to a diet of 5,000 calories per day. I meticulously planned my diet to have about 200 g of carbs, 150 g protein, and the remainder of the calories came from fat. I had two huge meals and two incredibly calorie-heavy shakes a day. (I still have vivid memories of stuffing an entire extra-large pizza down my gullet.) It was unpleasant, but it is not at all physiologically impossible or even terribly challenging (speaking as a normal, 5′ 11″ 170 lb male as I was at the time). By the end of 30 days (the limits of my experiment), I had gained 13 lbs. From my bodyfat % testing I was able to estimate that I had gained approximately 5 lbs of muscle (as a beginner weightlifter) and 8 lbs of fat. Deeming the experiment a failure, I immediately reversed course and lost all the fat over the next couple of months, but that’s a different story. If carried further, this rate of weight gain would not continue; eventually it would slow down and plateau. In addition, the rate of weight gain would differ according to many factors, including what your maintenance level is. However, 0.40 lbs a day is absolutely not out of the question.",8,0,1,1,0.0981416666666666,0.5740740740740741,1
18864,54368,6876,1,2019-06-01,892,"Grasslands are firstly characterized by a majority of the species being grasses and grass-like plants, members of the botanical families Poaceae (grasses) and Cyperaceae (sedges and rushes). There are usually significant numbers of forb species (sunflowers, asters and other broad-leaf flowering species). There are commonly smaller amounts of shrub and tree species. Grasslands are contrasted with forest-lands, which are predominantly small to large tree species. Prairies and savannas are the more common forms of grasslands. Grasslands are commonly found in regions with moderate to low rainfall, with forests usually predominating in regions with higher rainfall. Grasslands can also prosper in areas where fire occurs more frequently. In fact, grasslands can be maintained in forested regions by imposing higher fire frequency, via controlled burns. This is because each year’s growth of grasses starts over from plant parts that are found below the soil surface. These sources of new growth are thus safe from surface fires. Trees and shrubs, on the other hand, continue to grow and enlarge year after year, and young trees are thus subject fire-kill. Restraining forest development allows for grassland development. Soils under long-term grasslands are usually higher in organic matter content in the upper layers. This is because individual roots of grasses are short-lived, and the plants persist by constantly producing replacement roots. Long-term root dying and decomposition, supported by continuous growth of replacement roost, results in accumulation of organic matter in the upper layers of the soil. The magnificent soils of the midwestern US corn belt area the result of millennia of development under tall-grass prairies.",11,0,0,1,0.1219625,0.4354858104858105,1
7898,77767,4860,0,2016-05-31,24204,"The most common question pet owners ask about pet insurance is: ""Is pet insurance worth it?"" It’s a valid question and one worth exploring. I think that people often have the wrong attitude about pet insurance. For example, it's not uncommon for someone to say they would rather just open up a savings account to pay their veterinary expenses rather than ""waste"" money on pet insurance premiums.People buy insurance of any kind to help them pay for large, unexpected or unplanned expenses for which they would have trouble paying for out-of-pocket. So, if your pet were seriously sick or injured and required major surgery and/or an extended hospital stay, would you be willing to spend $5,000 or $10,000 if required? If your answer is yes, but you’re worried about how you would afford it, then you should at least look into purchasing pet insurance. I believe that more and more, pet owners will purchase pet insurance in the future because technology and the costs of delivering quality healthcare to pets have outpaced the ability of many pet owners to pay for it. While pet owners and veterinarians can potentially benefit from third party payment to help pay for the healthcare of pets, I'm convinced the real winners will be the pets.",7,0,3,1,0.0069999999999999,0.502639751552795,-1
84222,40375,3733,0,2020-05-30,6052,"There’s three reasons why they won’t unless there’s some sort of cow disaster on the scale of the current coronavirus. First. their ReputationBurger King has essentially spent it’s entire existence as being a meat-based fast food purveyor of flame-grilled burgers. The bulk of their customers go to them for exactly just that, and only want actual beef with no interest whatsoever to switch. They are the home of the WHOPPER. Not the Impossible Whopper. Not the Black-Bean whopper. The Whopper.  (Taken from burger-king-home-of-the-whopper) Try explaining to a person in their 60’s that the same Whopper they already know and enjoy might be as good being all plants, and most will tell you why change to an already good thing. Second, Distrust in Plant-based “Meat”Generations Y, Z and Millennials might be totally trusting in science (especially the Millennials), but not everyone else. Quite a few are suspicious in the science and the health claims that the Impossible Meat people claim. There’s great sales in these meats, but it’s still seen presently as more of a huge fad than a real breakthrough in food. A load of people who look at the Impossible whopper, once they hear that the meat patty is made of 21 different ingredients, automatically think “chemicals” and “science gone mad”.  (Taken from WHAT'S IN BURGER KING'S IMPOSSIBLE WHOPPER? — Ingredient Inspector) Anyone versed in basic chemistry and food science can see that there’s nothing there that’s dangerous, but how many people really do remember their high school chemistry? I mean, take a look on how popular Vani the Food Babe is, especially on how she uses bad science interpretation to go after companies like Subway for ingredients that are harmless. Third, PRICEThe Impossible Whopper is nowhere as cheap as beef based on current volume. Up here in Canada, I’ve gotten in the occasional deals as much as TWO Whoppers for $6. There have been times that the Impossible Whopper has been sold for the same price as the Whopper, but only for limited times as a loss leader to introduce people to the new burger. I don’t know the cost and price point, but I suspect they’re now selling the Impossible Whopper in such deals at cost or at a very small profit (a quarter) or even at a total LOSS.  (Taken from Burger King adds Impossible Whopper to value menu) It’s simply the law of supply and demand. If the Impossible Whopper sells as much as the Whopper does, the price will STILL be higher simply because the maker of the Impossible Meat company hasn’t been able to get the cost of production down low enough yet. Normal meat won’t be going off the menu anytime soon, and current meat production in the world is unsustainable in the long run. But there’s a NEW wrinkle as well. LAB-GROWN BEEF is now getting cheap enough to make to turn into burgers and so on, with an environmental impact that as much or even LESS than Impossible Meat or Beyond Meat.  (From Viewpoint: Lab-grown meat should replace farm animals as food) WIth this now coming (it’s been approved for sale in Europe, so not long until the US gets it), the ethical meat is going to be the future of fast-food in the long run. It’s very likely going to be the main way we get meat in 20 years. And if you’re thinking that “Big Beef” or “Big Pork” or “Big Chicken” will never let this happen, who do you think funded the creation of these new ways to make meat in the first place?  (Taken from Is 2019 The Year Of Lab-Grown Protein? - CB Insights Research)",5,0,3,1,0.0403333333333333,0.531335334638906,1
62126,22235,3372,2,2017-05-31,14927,"Soaring birds like the vulture and eagles gain altitude by using rising currents of air. Soaring (glider) pilots refer to them as “thermals” because they are usually caused by convection currents caused by ground that absorbs the warmth of the sun better than the surrounding areas (like a dark plowed field surrounded by lighter fields with things growing in them). The warm ground transfers the warmth to the air, and the air rises because warm air is lighter than colder air. Because the thermal is a tightly constrained column of air, birds (and sailplanes) circle to remain in the column of air as long as they can, in order to gain altitude without using their own energy, whether by flapping in the case of a bird or by running the motor in the case of the motor glider, or by using a tow from a powered plane in the case of a pure sail plane. There might be an additional benefit in the case of a carrion eater like a vulture - the rising air might also carry up to it any scents of dead animals. I don’t know if there is any research on whether that’s a factor, or if they just want to be high so they can see a long distance and glide down to whatever prey/carrion they might see.",14,0,0,1,0.3775833333333333,0.4742002442002442,1
